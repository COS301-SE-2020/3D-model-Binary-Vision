# 3D Model Binary Vision Project

Team Landing Page: https://vanillav.github.io/FlapJacks.github.io/

A mobile web application that will allow a user to scan a physical object and produce a 3 Dimensional model that can be viewed from any direction. The user will also have the choice to build the model from cameras moving sub sections of video. The videos will consist of SFM clips. Once the model has been built, the user must be able to store both the stereo-lithography as well as the surface information (such as colouring). The user can select a stored model and generate a 3D render on a Web Page, where they will be able to rotate the model.

  For Demo 1: Created and managed the user stories using the project management tools and set deadlines for work to be
              completed. Created the Use Case Diagram for the Media & Render Subsystem. Revised the System Requirements
              Specification Document and created Functional Requirements. Implemented Unit Testing for the Signup operations with
              the API integration.
