\# 3D Model Binary Vision Project
=================================

https://vanillav.github.io/FlapJacks.github.io/

A mobile web application that will allow a user to scan a physical
object and produce a 3 Dimensional model that can be viewed from any
direction. The user will also have the choice to build the model from
cameras moving sub sections of video. The videos will consist of SFM
clips. Once the model has been built, the user must be able to store
both the stereo-lithography as well as the surface information (such as
colouring). The user can select a stored model and generate a 3D render
on a Web Page, where they will be able to rotate the model.

Contributions:

Demo 1: Created the html and css for all pages, also
included some js to help with the integration between the signup/login
and the API. Created the forms for the signup and login. Revised over
the final analysis of the system functionality.

Demo 2: Add to the html and css as to update the UI and UX, helped work on the API
via front-end contribution in javascript. Made sure that all data is presented from the API on the website.
Furthermore, ensured that all data is applicable to modern day dentists.

Contributions:

Demo 1: Created simple javascript webGL program that renders verticies
that are passed to it. For documentation, I created a use-case diagram from retrieving
patient information and editing patients.

Demo 2: Researched and created the first step to 3d Point cloud generation (Camera calibration).
Created the deployment model diagram.

Contributions:

Demo 1: Created the database and the Node.js API that
connects the front and back end. I was part of the Integration process to
integrate the front end and back end. For the documentation I did the Introduction,
functional and quality requirements. I also set up the basic document that the
team then changed and inserted into as they seemed nescesary and what was assigned
to them.

Demo 2: Created API functions to handle requests of add patients, view patients, view single patients
send emails, creating and clearing cookie data , make sure all data returned belongs to a certain doctor.
Database queries to get the information on the backend. Created the Front End API calls as well.

Contributions:

Demo 1: Created and managed the user stories using the project
management tools and set deadlines for work to be completed. Created the
Use Case Diagram for the Media & Render Subsystem. Revised the System
Requirements Specification Document and created Functional Requirements.
Implemented Unit Testing for the Signup operations with the API
integration.

Demo 2: Assisted in the research for the 3D model render from SFM footage.
I integrated the code for the high level render from an STL file for the
patients model. I set up the HTML page to take an STL file as input from
the user. Updated the System Requirement Specification to meet the new
demo requirements by adding in new Use cases and functional requirements,
as well as updating the old use case diagrams. I also made the user manual
for the system.

Contributions:

Demo 1: I created the tractability matrix for the documentation
of the system. I implemented the Video capture functionality that allows the users
to send a live recorded video or a pre-recorded video from the clients machine to
back end for processing. I also contributed to the unit testing of the systems API calls.

Demo 2: I was in control of unit testing and code integration for the project. I 
implemented some new unit tests for the api, and linked travis ci (the continuous 
integration tool we are using) to our Github repository so that when a commit is 
sent the repository it will be built and then run the unit tests to see that meaningful 
code was uploaded. I also edited the demo video.
